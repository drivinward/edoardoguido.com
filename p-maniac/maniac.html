  <p class="p-desc">This is a university project developed by Elena Filippi, Edoardo Guido and Arianna Meroni for the Computer Animation course of Politecnico di Milano.
    After a a couple of months spent on learning Blender and its possibilities with physics simulations, we were assigned the task of generating a short animation based on physical simulations.
    All the three of us being fascinated by the work of great artists Antoni Tudisco and Esteban Diacono, we started by using dance moves found on Youtube videos as a reference, and we ended up creating a music video for Michael Sembello's "Maniac", where many characters — each one with its own peculiar material — have their own stage to dance on.
