                            A group of five people had to design the brand and brand image for a university project &#40;laboratorio di progetto della comunicazione&#41;. <br>
                            The client would be a newly founded museum of graphic design &#40;the group was assigned the name 'Visual Museum'&#41;. <br>
                            The project is tailored for an interactive, dynamic museum.

                            VIMU &#40;Visual Museum&#41; is a newly born, interactive, and dynamic museum. Taking this as a start point, its branding and brand image were conceived following these two values: the logo was created using oblique lines, which give the sense of dynamic, of movement. <br>
                            The font used for the logotype is Montserrat Bold.

                        <p class="project-paragraph">
                            The chromatic palette has been designed to return maximum vibrance and make the logo perception even&nbsp;more&nbsp;dynamic. <br>
                            By combining the different colours, it is possible to create great contrast and keep good&nbsp;chromatic&nbsp;harmony.
                        </p><br>

                        <p class="project-paragraph">
                            VIMU's branding has been relatively difficult, since there were many proposals about the key visuals at the beginning, and it was difficult to find a consistent way to visually represent the brand's values. <br>
                            The result of this has been a system of oblique lines &#40;which recall the logo elements&#41; that is present through all the products: block-notes, pencils, pins, business cards, tickets, letterhead and posters.

                        <p class="project-paragraph">
                            Another task of the project was to design and curate an exhibition for a famous designer that we liked. <br>
                            Our choice was Chip Kidd, as he is one of the most creative designers around since many years and his works are famous even without his name on it. <br><br>
                            The challenge here was to capture the artist's key elements and approach to design, in order to use them for the exhibition's communication. <br>
                            Chip Kidd's famous book covers always have a sense of mystery, as the reader gets the full meaning of them only when he/she has fully read and understood the book. <br><br>
                            As he himself said during one of his speeches&#58;"Mystery demands to be decoded."

                            The website of the museum is the output of a User Experience study. It was designed by following a simple principle: immediacy. <br><br>
                            It features three key elements: the header, which immediately shows the main events that are happening and the opening hours of the current day; the social dashboard, which engages the user through the various social networks and lets him/her discover the many design pieces which are exhibited; the menu, through which it's possible to reach every part of the website, with just a click; ViBot, the ovvicial VIMU bot, which lets users make reservations (museum or restaurant cafe), or buy gifts from the book shop.

                        <p class="project-paragraph">
                            The main purpose of the mobile app was to extend the in-museum experience. <br>
                            For this reason, the mobile app checks the user's position when launched. If the user is inside the museum, the interface adapts itself to let him/her interact with the museum's main exhibition on Art Direction in videogames &#40;hence why the gamepad appears on screen&#41;; if then the user is outside, the app itself becomes capable of giving directions to the museum, info about the exhibitions.
