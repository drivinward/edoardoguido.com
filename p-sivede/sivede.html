  <p class="p-desc">The aim of this project was developing a simple game for iPad, Android Tablets or Smartphones based on the children's book "Si&nbsp;vede non&nbsp;si&nbsp;vede" by Silvia Borando who, in turn, is the founder of Minibombo, a book editor that designs books for children.<br>
  A team of five people has realized an animated trailer that illustrates the way the application works over a week of workshop at Politecnico di Milano (and lead by Elena&nbsp;Caratti).<br>
  The child user is asked to find the animals that are hidden in the different scenes, and the puzzles that have to be solved require the interaction with the objects inside the scene.<br>
  The workshop is the result of a collaboration between the editor Mimibombo in Politecnico di Milano.
